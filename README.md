## Small Form App
### The form validates name, email, and message length, shows appropriate error/success messages, and logs submissions to console. You can easily extend this to save to a database or send emails.

- **Clean, responsive form with validation**
- **Flash messages for success/errors**
- **Form data preserved on validation failure**
- **Console logging of submissions**
- **Mobile-friendly design**
- **Easy to extend (add database, email notifications, etc.)**
